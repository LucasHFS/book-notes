## Fix Bugs Efficiently and Cleanly

### Understand the problem
- Don’t rush into coding before searching the problem’s context
- Use the buggy software and see the problem yourself
- Talk briefly with a project stakeholder about how the feature should work

Roadblocks:
- Misunderstanding the problem
- No access to the production system or stakeholders
- An actual emergency or business priority
- Pressure to immediately start coding

### Write tests that fail
- It’ll be your to-do list
- You’ll code with more confidence

Roadblocks:
- There is no existing test suite
- No infrastructure for tests at the ‘level’ you need to test


### Solve the problem as quickly as you can
- Make sure that the problem you are solving can be solved
- Make your tests green
- Don’t report progress when finishing this step

### Refactor for Maintainability and Readability
- Refactor your code
- Don’t over-engineer and know when to quit

100% sloppy -  Clean code - 100% elegant

### Commit your changes
- Take a special care to write a good message
- The first line of your commit message should estate, as briefly and specifically as possible, what the change is.
