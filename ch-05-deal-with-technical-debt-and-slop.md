## Deal With Technical Dept and Slop

## Slop: Code to Fix Now
- It is code:
  - poorly written
  - counter-intuitive
  - with duplication
  - with poor test coverage
  - missing error handling
  - with inconsistent use of logging
  - with lack of validation of assumptions
- Quickly fixable

## Technical Dept: Code to Fix Later (or Never)
- Technical dept is code written under certain assumptions that no longer hold
- It’s a code that makes a tradeoff
- It’s a way to deliver results when they’re needed
