# Chapter 1. Welcome to Your New Career

# Chapter 2. Focus on Delivering Results
## 2.1.-Results
- Tools and techniques such as project plans, estimates, and delivery schedules are useful, but different from working software
- Result is an artifact of direct business value:
  - Working code
  - Documentation
  - Definitive statements
## 2.2.-Focus
- Is the act of concentrating interest or activity on something.
- Certain coding tasks would be impossible if you were unable to focus
- Focusing on results: apply this focus to every aspect of your job
## 2.3.-Deliver Smaller Results More Often
- Itâ€™s hard to estimate large projects
- Avoid making promises
- By not reporting progress between deliveries, your project will lack visibility.
- Re-imagine your project as a series of small results-driven deliverables.
  - it turns a boring progress report into working, usable software
  - promises of smaller value over shorter time are easier to keep
## 2.4.-Plans, Schedules, and Status Reports
Think of yourself, your team, and your company as an onion:
- Youâ€™re at the center and each layer represents the larger structure of which you are a part.
- Inside each layer planning, tracking, processes and other tools for delivery should be used
- But each layer delivers only results to the layer around it

## 2.5.-Moving On

# Chapter 3. Fix Bugs Efficiently and Cleanly
## 3.1.-Overview
## 3.2.-Understand the Problem
- Donâ€™t rush into coding before searching the problemâ€™s context
- Use the buggy software and see the problem yourself
- Talk briefly with a project stakeholder about how the feature should work

Roadblocks:
- Misunderstanding the problem
- No access to the production system or stakeholders
- An actual emergency or business priority
- Pressure to immediately start coding
## 3.3.-Write Tests that Fail
- Itâ€™ll be your to-do list
- Youâ€™ll code with more confidence

Roadblocks:
- There is no existing test suite
- No infrastructure for tests at the â€˜levelâ€™ you need to test
## 3.4.-Solve the Problem as Quickly as You Can
- Make sure that the problem you are solving can be solved
- Make your tests green
- Donâ€™t report progress when finishing this step
## 3.5.-Modify Your Code for Maintainability and Readability
- Refactor your code
- Donâ€™t over-engineer and know when to quit

100% sloppy -  Clean code - 100% elegant
## 3.6.-Commit Your Changes
- Take a special care to write a good message
- The first line of your commit message should estate, as briefly and specifically as possible, what the change is.
## 3.7.-Example
## 3.8.-Is This Much Process Really Necessary?
## 3.9.-Moving On

# Chapter 4. Add Features with Ease
#### Basic Workflow for Implementing a Feature
![Basic Workflow for Implementing a Feature](imgs/basic-workflow-for-implementing-a-feature.png)
## 4.1.-Understand the Problem
- Identical to that in the previous slides, but itâ€™s more important here
- Before you meet, become intimately familiar with the documentation youâ€™ve been given
## 4.2.-Understand the System
- Answering these questions will help:
- What domain objects will this feature need to interact with?
- What business rules exist around those objects?
- What structures are in place to manage those objects?
- What new objects will you need to create?
- What is the test coverage like? Will you need to add test coverage anywhere before making changes?
## 4.3.-Create Acceptance Level Tests
- It simulates a user using the feature as closely as possible
## 4.4.-Plan your Implementation
- You donâ€™t need to generate some detailed publishable documentation
- The point is to think a bit about how youâ€™re going to get this task done and create a mental roadmap of how itâ€™ll work
- If you cannot explain to another developer how youâ€™re going to solve this problem, you are ill-equipped to start coding
- The best approach is to actually discuss the plan you made with another developer

## 4.5.-Repeat the Test/Fix/Refactor Cycle
- Work in small steps
- Work clean
## 4.6.-Get a Code Review
- Preparing the Review
  - summarize what the feature is and what it solves in just a few short sentences
- Responding to Feedback
- Incorporating Feedback
## 4.7.-Commit Your Changes
- Organize your commit messages
## 4.8.-How to Report Progress
![Basic Workflow for Implementing a Feature](imgs/basic-workflow-for-implementing-a-feature.png)

- 1-4: â€˜understanding the problemâ€™
- 5: â€˜codingâ€˜ or â€˜in progressâ€˜
- 6,7: â€™in reviewâ€™

Report at a regular status meeting if your team does them, with what youâ€™ve done or what you plan to work on next, but with no indication of any level of completeness.

## 4.9.-Moving On

# Chapter 5. Deal With Technical Debt and Slop
## 5.1.-Slop: Code to Fix Now
- It is code:
  - poorly written
  - counter-intuitive
  - with duplication
  - with poor test coverage
  - missing error handling
  - with inconsistent use of logging
  - with lack of validation of assumptions
- Quickly fixable
## 5.2.-Technical Debt: Code to Fix Later (or Never)
- Technical dept is code written under certain assumptions that no longer hold
- Itâ€™s a code that makes a tradeoff
- Itâ€™s a way to deliver results when theyâ€™re needed
