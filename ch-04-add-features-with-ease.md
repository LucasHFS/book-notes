## Add Features with Ease

#### Basic Workflow for Implementing a Feature

### Understand the Problem
- Identical to that in the previous slides, but it’s more important here
- Before you meet, become intimately familiar with the documentation you’ve been given

### Understand the System
- Answering these questions will help:
- What domain objects will this feature need to interact with?
- What business rules exist around those objects?
- What structures are in place to manage those objects?
- What new objects will you need to create?
- What is the test coverage like? Will you need to add test coverage anywhere before making changes?

### Create Acceptance-Level Tests
- It simulates a user using the feature as closely as possible

### Plan your Implementation
- You don’t need to generate some detailed publishable documentation
- The point is to think a bit about how you’re going to get this task done and create a mental roadmap of how it’ll work
- If you cannot explain to another developer how you’re going to solve this problem, you are ill-equipped to start coding
- The best approach is to actually discuss the plan you made with another developer


### Repeat the Test/Fix/Refactor Cycle
- Work in small steps
- Work clean

### Get a Code Review
- Preparing the Review
  - summarize what the feature is and what it solves in just a few short sentences
- Responding to Feedback
- Incorporating Feedback

### Commit Your Changes
- Organize your commit messages

### How to Report Progress

- 1-4: ‘understanding the problem’
- 5: ‘coding‘ or ‘in progress‘
- 6,7: ’in review’

Report at a regular status meeting if your team does them, with what you’ve done or what you plan to work on next, but with no indication of any level of completeness.
