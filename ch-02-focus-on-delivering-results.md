## Focus on Delivering  Results

### Results
- Tools and techniques such as project plans, estimates, and delivery schedules are useful, but different from working software
- Result is an artifact of direct business value:
  - Working code
  - Documentation
  - Definitive statements


### Focus
- Is the act of concentrating interest or activity on something.
- Certain coding tasks would be impossible if you were unable to focus
- Focusing on results: apply this focus to every aspect of your job


### Deliver smaller results more often
- It’s hard to estimate large projects
- Avoid making promises
- By not reporting progress between deliveries, your project will lack visibility.
- Re-imagine your project as a series of small results-driven deliverables.
  - it turns a boring progress report into working, usable software
  - promises of smaller value over shorter time are easier to keep


### Plans, schedules, and status reports
Think of yourself, your team, and your company as an onion:
- You’re at the center and each layer represents the larger structure of which you are a part.
- Inside each layer planning, tracking, processes and other tools for delivery should be used
- But each layer delivers only results to the layer around it
